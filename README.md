# React movie search using TMDB API

This project was done as a quick test of my React skills. I created a movie search system, where movies are returned via GET request when the user inputs a search term. The API is hidden using .env and webpack (hidden from commit for security reasons).

The styling of the project was purposefully left in barebones state, as it was not the priority for this project.
